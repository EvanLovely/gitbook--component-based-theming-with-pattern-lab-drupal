# Component Based Theming with Pattern Lab & Drupal

> How to integrate the Twig templates, CSS, and JavaScript of a Drupal CMS and Pattern Lab acting as your Styleguide, Component Library, and Prototyping Tool.

# There's a better way

[Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) is many wonderful things: a [style guide](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides), a [component inventory](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/), a [prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) system, and the embodiment of a [design philosophy](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), all wrapped inside a fundamentally simple tool – a static site generator. It has greatly improved the approach of how we build, theme, and design websites. Let’s talk about what Pattern Lab is, how we use it in the process by integrating it into the theme of a Drupal CMS, and how that can result in a change of the development workflow from linear to parallel.
